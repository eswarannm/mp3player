What I learned:
  This project helped me expand my understanding of python and utilize the tools built in and using to the language to create a working music player. I learned a lot about how many different uses there are for PIL and pygame. I also solidified my understanding of logic and syntax regarding python because when merging the pause and play buttons and creating the small lyric game. Some challenges I faced included installing pygame, which seems to be difficult for everyone according to the internet. I also had some challenges with using a mac and had to manually shut off Apple's System Integrity Protection. Other than that I had fun with the rest of the project. Overall, I now feel confident in using and solving problems with python.
